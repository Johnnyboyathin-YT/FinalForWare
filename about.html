        <p>When making this website, I really thought this would be the hardest thing i have ever done. I really was proven wrong by the few days i had left in this work. I have always wanted to get the youtube channal to the peak quality i really desired. I tried to record fotage of some games, but i naver got the courage to do so.
        <p>I really want to shout out my youtube channel; Johnnyboyathin, Mr. Ware. I hope you can somehow try to get the channel supported!</p>
